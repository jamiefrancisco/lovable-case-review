# FlowHub Case Review

This project demonstrates how I might approach real customer scenarios at the intersection of
technical problem-solving and customer success.

## What this is
- A Lovable-built workspace (FlowHub) representing a real product customers interact with
- A lightweight Case Review tool showing how I:
  - diagnose issues
  - communicate clearly with customers
  - extract playbooks and product feedback

## What to look at
- `/cases` — a queue of realistic customer situations
- Case detail pages — investigation, findings, customer response, internal notes
- Tags — how issues get categorized into repeatable patterns

## Why I built it
I’m interested in customer-facing roles where technical understanding, clear communication,
and customer impact all matter. This project reflects how I think and work in those environments.

Built with React + TypeScript. No backend — intentionally focused on clarity and structure.
